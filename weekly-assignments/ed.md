# Electronics Design
Welcome to the amazing world of electronics design. During this week we will learn tools and acquire some skills to be able to design our own circuit boards, which together with the skills of Electronics Production will allow us to fabricate our own circuit boards. And this is not only super cool, but also a huge step in digital fabrication.

* Electronics and programming is NOT a one step learning process. It is a permanent learning process. Depth is infinite. The more you give, the more you obtain.

* Basics about electronic components

* Basics about microcontrollers

    * Registers

    * Fuses (HIGH, LOW, EXTENDED) Tutorial: [http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/doc/fuses.html](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/doc/fuses.html) 

    * Interrupts

    * ADC

## Learning about components
It is a good week to learn a little bit about how the components work. A good resource is the O'Reilly Enciclopedia of Electronic Components (link coming soon in [Ryver](https://fabacademy2016.ryver.com)). Do you know what are these components for and how do they work?

* Battery
* Capacitor
* Resistor
* Pushbutton
* Diode/LED
* IC. Remember to look into the datasheet, not all the pins are valid for your goal!

## Eagle Tutorial
Even if you are not planning to use Eagle you **still have to learn Eagle** because you will find many designs out there using this format. You have to learn how to create the Schematic Design first and then the Design Layout. These are two half an hour tutorials:

## `.cad` Tutorial
Please do your meditation before we go into this because we are entering a parallel universe. We are entering the world of kokopelli. Will your body and mind be ready to unlock the door?
