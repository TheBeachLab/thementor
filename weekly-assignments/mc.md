# Molding and Casting

Designing sigle sided mold in antimony

* Forward design (start with the castable object) vs backwards design (start with the wax you have)

* Silicon clearance

* Wax clearance

* Advantages of antimony

* DESIGN FOR the tool you have or BUY A TOOL for the job you want to mill

* Inner corner limitation and design workaround

* Tool depth limitation

* Clearance parameter in fab modules (compiled version only)

Mixing

Pay attention. By volume not necessarily equal to by weight!!!

Remember. Expensive material. Calculate silicon volume or weight and allow 25% extra
