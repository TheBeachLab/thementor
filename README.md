# Fab Academy Mentoring Bits
Dedicated to all the people who makes Fab Academy possible. 

## Who am I and what is this
Hello, my name is Francisco, I am from Barcelona, Spain. I have been a Fab Academy instructor since 2014. This book is a guide with mentoring advice for Fab Academy instructors. I started this guide while being a Fab Academy instructor in Dubai and I will continue to develop it through the years to come. I am not a professional educator, but I like to talk to students. I believe that education is not about infusing knowledge, but about revealing the potential of every person.

## Disclaimer
All what you will read here is my particular vision after several years of mentoring Fab Academy and Pre Academy students around the globe. But be warned, this vision is not necesarily coincident with Neil's, Fab Foundation's, Fab Academy or the rest of the instructors.
