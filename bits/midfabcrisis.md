# The Mid Fab Crisis

It might happen around the break. Or perhaps during input devices. The exact moment is actually unimportant.

There is a moment in life, when you sit back and analise what you dreamed to be when you were a kid, and you compare it against what you actually are. The mismatch is called mid life crisis, and great life changes will occur.

There is an equivalent in Fab Academy. We all have expectations. Big ideas for final projects, amazing inventions and innovations that we don't know how we will make them, but we heard that Fab Academy was the course for learning how to make (almost) anything. So we had blind faith that we would somehow learn what's required to fullfill our dreams. But no one told us that we had to sweat.

What is important is that as a instructor you have to be ready to support your students when this moment arises. It is a good opportinity to reinforce the value of effort and sacrifice in learning. We live in a society of instant gratification, were effort is deprecated, and the student might be tempted to think that his global-problem-solving innovation will come after typing a few magic lines of code, and using that magic designing software they saw in facebook. Behind any great project there is always lots of research, lots of effort, lots of failures, lots of critical moments and lots of learning.
