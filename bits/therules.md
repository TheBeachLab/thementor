# The rules

## Question
> Can I bend or break the rules?

## Short Answer
Yes. But to break the rules you have to master the rules.

## Long answer
Rules are set as a guide to learn something. Something that is important. Probably a principle or a workflow. Once you master the rule, you are strongly encouraged to bend or break the rule and explore, analize and learn from the different results. But breaking the rules without mastering them is like the story of the [donkey and the flute](donkeyandflute.md).
