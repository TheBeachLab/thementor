# No one gets left behind, remember?

Some people learn faster, some people slower, some persons are more independent, some need more assistance. As the weeks go by you will start noticing different progress speeds. And that will slowly erode the morale of the students, both of the ones that fall behind and the others that are continuosly being asked for help. Division, individual goals and selfish behaviors, specially towards the end of the program, will arise.

Fab Academy is not a competition. There is no prize, reward or recognition waiting for you. All this code, the machines and the processes, all this will be soon obsolete. Our sons will not believe that we waited 14 hours for a 3D print, no matter who hard you try to convince them. But the relationships, the friendship that you will forge, this will last forever.

Fab Academy is a distributed learning experience. We all have knowledge in different aspects, and different kinds of intelligence, even different ideology, different age, we might come from different culture and follow a different religion. But we are not better than any other. And we never, ever, leave no one behind. Never. If someone falls, we pull each other up. This is how it is.
