# Computer-Aided Design

## General tips
This week is actually **much more than 2D and 3D design**. It'd rather be called representation and communication of ideas. **The goal this week is to try as much as possible of these tools and learn which one is good for what and when**. As per outcomes you will be asked to show one example of 2D design and one example of 3D design, at least.

## 2D Design
Assorted 2D design recommendations

* Try at least one raster and one vector tool.
* Learn how to vectorize a B/W image. You will need to do this many times.

## 3D Design
Assorted 3D design recommendations

* Remember you need to include **the original and editable file format** that you used to create the design. Exports to other file formats like `.stl` are optional.
* If you want to include a `.stl` file consider hosting it in [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) and embedding it inside your webpage like this:

## Audio and video
This section is not required for the evaluation, but recommended for your personal success.

* Selfie video: Many incubators and accelerators will ask you to record a video where you show you and your team. If you are planning to start a [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com) campaign for a product you want to sell you will also have to do the same. Try to record a 10 to 15 seconds video presenting yourself. Do you think it's easy? Let's see how many times you have to repeat the scene until you are satisfied.
* Screen recording: Sometimes the best way to show something that you are doing in a computer is with a screen capture video (with or without voice over). A good screen recorder for GNU/Linux is [SimpleScreenRecorder](http://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/). Record a 30 seconds video showing something you do on screen.
* Do not underestimate the legacy `.gif` format. It is very useful to show short videos (2 to 5 seconds) like a led blinking. It also shows your emotions and helps the people understand how do you feel doing fab academy. It does not require autoplay. There are a number of resources for downloading, manipulating or converting to `.gif` like [Giphy](http://giphy.com/), [Ezgif](http://ezgif.com/video-to-gif) and many more. Try them.

* Experiment with adding titles and subtitles to your videos (in another language or for people with disabilities for example). Subtitles can be hardcoded or softcoded, find out the difference. You can create subtitles with YouTube Creator Studio.
