# The final project

    * Remember: it is a 1 week project (production time). 

    * Your research may take the whole semester.

    * Remember: Fab academy will not convert you into a (you name it)

    * Think about you. Your hobbies and interests

    * Propose what you want to do. Forget how to do it

    * Must be sellable

    * Make meaning. Guy Kawasaki video

        * Increase the quality of life

        * Right a wrong

        * To prevent the end of something good

    * The three types of final projects

        * The good. Simple, well crafted

        * The bad. Overcomplicated, does not solve any problem

        * The ugly. Bad documented, horrible aspect


* Start learning now!

    * edX

    * Youtube

    * Instructables

* Remember: There is a difference between **knowing** the path and **walking** the path. Walk-the-path.

* Remember to document the process every day. Exercise the habit of documenting.

*_"Common sense is not so common" _**

* *Voltaire*

This week you will apply what you have learned in the previous weeks and put it into practice to develop a short, "sprint" project. 

You must use a microcontroller (one input and one output) and at least 3 FabLab processes. Machines are not processes. 

* Onus is on the student, not the instructor. 

* Approach this as a challenge. 

* Narrow the scope of the project to something achievable in the time we have.

* Use your common sense!

* Use this as an opportunity to practice on the machines. 

* Manage your resources and time appropriately.

* Iterate as many times as possible.

* Progress gradually in the resources you use. Prototype smartly. 

* Questions are always ok!

* Not knowing how to do something doesn’t mean you can’t do it. The key is to know how to find out. 

* Something personal is always a better starting point - you already know a lot about yourself. Market of one.

We will add a desktop source, a webcam source and an logo image to overlay both.

Final projects. The good, the bad and the ugly
