# Invention, Intellectual Property and Income

There are two goals this week. One is learning about the different available licenses for our work, evaluate them and choosing one for our final project. The second one is writting a dissemination plan for our final project.

Those are very important weeks in Fab academy if one of your goals is making money from the things you will be able to build in the coming future.
